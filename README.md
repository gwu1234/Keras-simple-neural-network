# Learning Keras Neural Networks

It is a self education project, following a Udemy course, 

learning how to implement Neural Network and build 

deep learning machine with Keras.

Three simple projects included here:

1) linearRegression:

it is a one-variable regression fitting, with a one-neuron and one-layer network


2) basicSequentialNetwork:

it is multiple variable regression fitting, with a three-layers sequential network 

3) convolutionalNetwork

it is a seven-layers convolutionalNetwork for recognition of handwritten digits
